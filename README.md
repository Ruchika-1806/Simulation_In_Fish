# Schooling_Behaviour_In_Fish

1) The project simulate the schooling behaviour of fish in presence of external agents such as food and obstacles.<br>
2) Simulation of school behavior has been implemented in virtual environment on Unity platform. The fish models that have been used in the project have been downloaded from the Unity Asset store.<br>
3) I have also tried to implement obstacle avoidance in this experient.The obstacle are shown as 3d cylinders that have been used are the game objects from the unity itself.<br>
4) Apart from avoiding obstacles, school implement another rule of goal seeking. The goal has been shown as a 3-D sphere in the simulated virtual environment. The position of the goal changes randomly at irregular intervals between the dimensions specified. Fish moves towards the target while following other rules.
